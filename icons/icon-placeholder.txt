ICON PLACEHOLDER FILES NEEDED:

Please create the following PNG icon files in this directory:

- icon-16.png  (16x16 pixels)
- icon-32.png  (32x32 pixels) 
- icon-48.png  (48x48 pixels)
- icon-128.png (128x128 pixels)

SUGGESTED ICON DESIGN:
- Theme: Learning/Education with speed/throttling concept
- Colors: Blue/Purple gradient (matches extension theme)
- Symbol Ideas: 
  * Target (ðŸŽ¯) with book/reading element
  * Speedometer with book/graduation cap
  * Brain with Wi-Fi signal bars
  * Book with timer/clock element

TEMPORARY SOLUTION:
Until you create proper icons, you can:
1. Use any PNG files renamed to the required sizes
2. Use online icon generators (favicon.io, iconpng.com)
3. Convert emoji to PNG using tools like emoji-to-png

The extension will work without custom icons (browsers will use defaults), 
but custom icons improve the professional appearance.
