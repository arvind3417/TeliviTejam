# 🚀 LearnFirst Throttling - Quick Logging Reference

## 🔍 **Key Logs to Look For**

### **✅ WORKING CORRECTLY**

#### Extension Background (chrome://extensions/ → service worker):
```
🎯 LearnFirst: Background controller initializing...
🌐 LearnFirst: Setting up Manifest V3 compatible throttling...
🚦 LearnFirst: ENABLING THROTTLING - Progress: 0/3
✅ Injected content throttling into tab 123
```

#### Page Console (F12 → Console on any website):
```
🐌 Content throttling initialized for: https://example.com
🐌 Applying content throttling with base delay: 500ms
🖼️ Image loaded after 400ms delay
```

#### Learning Sites (Wikipedia, GitHub, etc.):
```
⚡ Learning site detected - no throttling applied
```

### **❌ COMMON PROBLEMS**

#### No logs at all:
- **Issue**: Extension not loaded
- **Fix**: Reload extension in chrome://extensions/

#### Throttling not working:
```
🚦 Throttling: current=false
```
- **Issue**: Goals completed
- **Fix**: Reset progress in popup

#### Content throttling missing:
```
Expected: 🐌 Content throttling initialized
Actual:   (nothing in page console)
```
- **Issue**: Script injection failed
- **Fix**: Check background for `⚠️ Could not inject` errors
